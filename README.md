# üöÄ AI Crypto Trading Bot üß†üìä

Welcome to the **AI Crypto Trading Bot** repository! This project integrates machine learning models with the Binance API to automate crypto trading decisions based on real-time market data. The bot implements a variety of models to make **buy** and **sell** recommendations, using an ensemble approach to ensure the best possible trading strategy. The bot can also place take-profit orders and calculate overall profit and loss (PnL) based on trading history.

## üìú Features

- **Multiple Machine Learning Models:** Combines recommendations from multiple models including:
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
  - Logistic Regression

- **Trade Automation:** Automatically places market buy/sell orders with Binance using the official **Binance API**. Supports placing **Take Profit** limit orders after each trade.
  
- **Profit and Loss Calculation:** Calculates the overall PnL based on executed trades and open orders.

- **Account Overview:** Fetches account balance and open order information for the specified trading pair.
  
- **Trade History Retrieval:** Tracks and retrieves historical trades for a specified trading pair.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Binance API:** Real-time crypto trading and account management.
- **Python** for logic and trading operations.
- **Machine Learning Models** for buy/sell recommendation (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVC, Logistic Regression).
  
## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

1. **Read Model Recommendations:** The bot reads trading recommendations from model output files (e.g., `random_forest_recommendation.txt`, `gradient_boost_recommendation.txt`).
  
2. **Aggregate Recommendations:** The bot uses majority voting to determine the final trading recommendation (buy or sell).
  
3. **Place Orders:** 
   - If the final recommendation is **Buy**, a market buy order is placed and a **Take Profit** sell order is set at a specified profit percentage.
   - If the final recommendation is **Sell**, a market sell order is placed, followed by a **Take Profit** buy order after shorting.
  
4. **Track Profit and Loss:** The bot tracks profit and loss based on trade execution and open orders.

5. **Monitor Account:** The bot fetches the current balance, open orders, and trade history for the trading pair, ensuring real-time monitoring of your account.

## üèóÔ∏è How to Run the Bot

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-crypto-trading-bot.git
   cd ai-crypto-trading-bot
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure your **Binance API Keys**:
   - Replace the placeholders for `API_KEY` and `API_SECRET` in the code with your actual Binance API keys.

4. Place your model recommendations in `.txt` files:
   - Ensure the recommendation files (e.g., `random_forest_recommendation.txt`, `gradient_boost_recommendation.txt`) exist and contain either "Buy" or "Sell" based on your model predictions.

5. Run the bot:
   ```bash
   python trading_bot.py
   ```

## üìù Example Output

- **Overall Recommendation:**
  ```
  Overall Recommendation: Buy
  ```

- **Trade Execution:**
  ```
  Buy order placed: {'symbol': 'BTCUSDT', 'orderId': 12345, ...}
  Take Profit order placed at 43000: {'symbol': 'BTCUSDT', 'orderId': 12346, ...}
  ```

- **Profit and Loss Calculation:**
  ```
  Total Profit/Loss: 50 USDT
  ```

## üí° Future Improvements

- **Integration with More Machine Learning Models:** Expand the set of models to include more advanced algorithms such as XGBoost, LSTM, or Reinforcement Learning.
  
- **Backtesting:** Implement a backtesting framework to simulate trades and test different strategies before deploying in real-time trading.
  
- **Risk Management:** Add risk management features such as stop-loss, trailing stop orders, and dynamic position sizing based on account balance and market conditions.
